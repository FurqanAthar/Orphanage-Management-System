# Orphanage-Management-System

This Orphanage Management System is a database-focused web application developed using PHP and MySQL. It was developed as part of my databases course project and the system is designed to manage and track data related to orphanages, sponsors, and their contributions.

## Key Features

### Orphanage Management

The system allows for the easy addition and management of data related to orphanages and their needs.

### Sponsor and Contribution Management

The system has a system for tracking and managing data related to sponsors and their contributions.

### Expense Tracking

The system allows for tracking expenses for different orphans on education, food, clothing, and other needs, and displaying the data in the form of graphs using Google Charts.

### Event Management:

The system allows for the easy creation and management of events, and the sending of notifications to sponsors.

### Sponsor and Guardian Dashboard:

The system has a dashboard for sponsors and guardians, allowing them to view details of spending and yearly reports.

### Child Sponsorship:

Guardians can take on a single child from the orphanage and sponsor its expenses, while a sponsor can fund the orphanage without sponsoring any particular person.

### Application Approval:

Both sponsors and guardians will have to submit their applications from the dashboard and admin will then approve it from his dashboard.

### Performance Testing:

The system has been tested by adding hundreds of thousands of entries to ensure that it can handle large amounts of data without crashing.
